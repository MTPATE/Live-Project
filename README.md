# Live-Project
During my time with The Tech Academy I worked on a 2 week sprint live project following the Scrum ideology. Along with fellow colleagues, we helped solve real world problems and communicated our daily progress. We worked as a collective but were assigned individual tasks catering to our respective skills. I was assigned offensive and defensive security challenges such as analyzing malware traffic, penetration testing, inspecting pcap files and finding vulnerabilities in applications. Some of these challenges called for tools and techniques such as Wireshark, Burp Suite, SQL injections and privilege escalation attacks to name a few.
